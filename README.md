# Disappearing-Tweet
Create a react web app which lets people write a tweet (just text), select a future date and the tweet will disappear after the selected date and time. Let's call it Disappearing Tweet. It will be a single page application (SPA) with one input box (for writing the tweet), a datetime picker and a button. Users can write a tweet, select date and time in future (past dates and time should be disabled) and click the tweet button. It will add the text (tweet)  in a list of cards which shows the time after which it will disappear. Store the data inside redux store.
