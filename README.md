Day 1 and Day 2 ----> As mentioned i created an input field to enter the tweet and another input field for date picker adding some basic visual features. Then i made a button with name="TWEET" having a "send" icon.

Day 3 ----> Binded the values so that on pressing the button TWEET the values of tweet and date gets stored in their respective fields. This is visible on the console screen.

Day 4 ----> Worked with learning the redux store and disabling date time picker.

Since, this feature was new to me, it took a bit more time but i did not lose hope and worked hard with it. I was unable to get through Redux store and disappering the value due to less experience but i look forward to work on it and complete all of it if i get more time and knowledge regarding this. I learned alot throughout the process and found it as a great opportunity to dig into it for these 4 days. I was able to do it enthusiastically as i keep interest in this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
